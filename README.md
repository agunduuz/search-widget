# Let's Make a Search! 🔍

The languages I used for this project were:

- **HTML**, 🌐
- **CSS**, 🎨
- **JavaScript**. 💻

It's a simple project, but a "Search Widget" that brings me joy when I see it on websites. 😊

Isn't it minimalist? 🧐

It doesn't take up much space and it's a dynamic search bar. ⚡️

You can access the live version from the 👉  [link below](https://search-widget-alpha.vercel.app/) . 

See you in the next project! 👋
